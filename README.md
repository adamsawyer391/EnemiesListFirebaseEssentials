# EnemiesListFirebaseEssentials
We all have one, don't we? 

This project demonstrates a basic MVVM architecture using Google Firebase and is written in Java. Instead of a plain old Notes app, 
we create an "enemies" list where we can add names, multiple photos for each individual, track the date they were added, set a status, determine their danger level and so on. 

The project includes a user registration and login activity, a main activity recyclerview listing all of our enemies, an add enemy activity and a view enemy activity. There are more features that could be added but this highlights the essentials of Firebase authentication, file storage, realtime database reading and writing as well as the Model-View-ViewModel architecture design pattern.
